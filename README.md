# LoLWinRatePredictionTool

A tool for predicting win rates in League of Legends

### **Project Task Overview: League of Legends Win Rate Prediction Tool**

#### **1\. Project Planning & Requirements Gathering**

-   Define the **scope and objectives** of the project.
-   Identify the **key data mining techniques** to be used.
-   Research and register for the **Riot Games API** or alternative data sources.
-   Select the **tech stack** (backend, frontend, database, and machine learning frameworks).

#### **2\. Data Collection & Storage**

-   **API Integration**: Fetch match history, champion stats, win rates, item builds, etc.
-   **Database Setup**: Store raw and processed match data (SQL or NoSQL).
-   **Data Preprocessing**:
    -   Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
    -   Normalize and structure data for easy analysis.

#### **3\. Data Mining & Feature Engineering**

-   **Extract key features** (e.g., champion synergy, counter-picks, item effectiveness).
-   Apply **association rule mining** to discover patterns in winning teams.
-   Use **clustering algorithms** to group similar champions.
-   Perform **trend analysis** on meta shifts and champion performance.

#### **4\. Machine Learning Model Development**

-   Choose and implement **classification/regression models** for win rate prediction (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks).
-   Train models on historical match data.
-   Evaluate models using **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.
-   Optimize model parameters and fine-tune for better performance.

#### **5\. Backend Development**

-   Develop a **Flask/FastAPI backend** to handle API requests.
-   Create endpoints for:
    -   Fetching win rate predictions.
    -   Retrieving champion and team insights.
-   Implement database queries for fast data retrieval.

#### **6\. Frontend Development**

-   Design a **React-based UI** with:
    -   Champion selection input.
    -   Display of predicted win rates and team insights.
    -   Graphical representation of historical trends.
-   Ensure a **responsive and user-friendly experience**.

#### **7\. Testing & Validation**

-   Perform **unit testing** on backend API and data processing functions.
-   Validate ML models using a test dataset.
-   Conduct **UI/UX testing** for usability improvements.

#### **8\. Deployment & Maintenance**

-   Deploy backend and frontend (e.g., AWS, Heroku, Vercel).
-   Set up **automatic data updates** to reflect the latest match stats.
-   Monitor performance and update models periodically.
